\b\fs28 What is the Internet of Behavior and Why is it Important for Business?\par
\b0\fs22 Did you know that the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has doubled over the past five years? These things are everywhere with us today, from wearable technologies that track your fitness 24/7 to remote access to electrical devices in your home. The shift to mobile devices has changed the way we interact with the world around us. The collection of usage data and data by these IoT devices provides valuable information about users\rquote  behavior, interests, and preferences. Thus the concept of Internet Behavior (IoB) was born.\par
\par
Let\rquote s look at what Internet of Behavior (IoB) is, what business value it is, and who can benefit from it. In other words, how to turn all the data collected from users\rquote  online activities into something useful usually means profit for companies. This question is now answered by a new concept: the Internet of Behavior (IoB).\par
What is the Internet of Behavior (IoB)?\par
Many cited 2012 as the opening date of IoB when psychology professor Gothe Nyman described the possibility of obtaining detailed data on customers\rquote  use and behavior as they interact with the Internet of Things (IoT). But the idea of \u8203?\u8203?analyzing data received from consumers for business purposes is not new. As we have done research on consumer behavior and habits in the past, we now have an automated ecosystem of analytic processes that track, collect, and attempt to interpret the vast amounts of data we generate through our online and Internet activities.\par
The IoB concept seeks to address how to understand data properly and apply that understanding to create and promote new products \f1\endash  from a human psychology perspective.\par
\par
The Internet of Behavior collects the digital dust of people\rquote s lives from a variety of sources, and public or private organizations can use this information to influence behavior\par
\par
says Gartner.\par
\par
Let\rquote s look at the web platform example when a user interacts with it from a laptop, and another time from his smartphone. The data will differ in how the user interacts with the resource, namely which buttons he clicks, how he moves around the page. Thanks to this approach, it becomes clear the path that leads to the sale. Everything we have listed is all the data that can be collected using analytics, and this is what makes up the Big Data concept.\par
\par
Well, let\rquote s say we collected this data, but what next? And then IoB comes into play.\par
\par
IoB is a process where user data is analyzed in terms of behavioral psychology. Based on this analysis, new approaches to the development of user experience (UX), search experience optimization (SXO), and end products and companies\rquote  services and how to promote them are formed.\par
\par
In its recent strategic forecasts for 2021, Gartner announced that the Internet of Behavior is something we will increasingly learn about in our daily lives and work. The research company combines existing technologies that focus directly on humans \endash  such as facial recognition, location tracking, and big data \endash  and links the resulting data to relevant behavioral events, such as cash purchases or device use.\par

\b The Top 4 Internet Of Things Trends In 2023\par
\b0 The Internet of Things (IoT) is a term that\rquote s come to be used to describe the ever-growing networks of physical objects that are online, connected, and capable of communicating and sharing information with us and with each other.\par
Computers and then smartphones were the first devices that were connected to the internet. Over the past decade, our homes have become filled with smart TVs, connected kitchen appliances such as kettles and fridges, and smart alarm systems, cameras, and lightbulbs. At the same time, we have become used to working alongside smart machinery in workplaces, driving smart cars, and even living in smart cities.\par
\par
In 2023, it\rquote s predicted that there will be more than 43 billion devices connected to the internet. They will generate, share, collect, and help us to make use of data in all manner of ways. So, here\rquote s an overview of some of the key trends that will affect how we use and interact with these devices during the coming year.\par
Digital Twins and the Enterprise Metaverse\par
\par
This is a convergence of two very important tech trends that will define how technology is used across industry and enterprise during 2023. For business, one of the most valuable applications of the metaverse will be bridging the gap between the real and virtual worlds. By using data from IoT sensors, it will be possible to build increasingly realistic digital twins of many different systems \endash  from manufacturing facilities to shopping malls. Business users will then be able to step inside these digital twins using experiential metaverse technology like VR headsets to get a better understanding of how they work and how adjusting individual variables is likely to influence business outcomes.\par
\par
We are already seeing applications of this technology convergence in retail, where store planners can monitor footfall in real-time and make adjustments to displays and promotions to monitor how this impacts customer behavior and, ultimately, revenue generation. In industrial settings, it allows designers of factories and manufacturing plants to experiment with different machinery configurations, as well as to highlight potential safety issues and predict when breakdowns might occur.\par
\par
IoT Security\par
\par
IoT devices make our lives easier and more convenient, but they also leave us open to new and varied forms of cyberattack. To put it simply, the more connected devices we have in our environments, the more doors and windows are potentially open to attackers. As the number of devices explodes during 2023 and beyond, businesses, device manufacturers, and security experts will step up the fight to keep "malicious actors" at bay, minimizing their chances of getting their hands on our valuable data.\par
\par
In the US, the White House National Security Council has stated that it hopes to have standardized security labeling in place for consumer IoT device manufacturers by early 2023. These will help buyers to understand what risks might be posed by specific devices they introduce into their homes. Many basic attacks, such as phishing attacks, rely on social engineering \endash  tricking users into divulging access details \endash  and can be thwarted by taking basic precautions. The UK is also expected to introduce its own Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure (PTSI) bill.\par
\par
For those involved in IoT \endash  particularly in the consumer space where networks can be the only barrier between thieves and hugely sensitive personal data \endash  spending on security measures is forecast to hit $6 billion during 2023.\par
\par
The Internet of Healthcare Things\par
\par
Healthcare is a huge area of opportunity for IoT technology, and the value of the market for IoT-enabled health devices is set to hit $267 billion by 2023.\par
\par
One of the biggest gamechangers is the use of wearables and in-home sensors to enable healthcare professionals to monitor the condition of patients outside of the hospital or doctor\rquote s surgery. This enables 24/7 care while freeing up valuable resources for patients who need immediate and direct care. In 2023 more of us will become familiar with the concept of the \ldblquote virtual hospital ward\rdblquote , where doctors and nurses will oversee the monitoring and treatment of patients in their own homes thanks to sensors and telemedicine.\par
\par
On the consumer side, wearable devices allow everyone to gain better insights into their own health and fitness, which again will help reduce the strain on existing healthcare systems by allowing us to seek help earlier when something is wrong, as well as gain a better understanding of how diet and exercise impact our health. Smartwatches featuring ECG and Sp02 sensors are now commonplace, and over the next year, we can expect to see more products, such as wearable skin patches. We may even see devices from Elon Musk\rquote s Neuralink, which is creating implants that read neurological signals \endash  one of the first applications being targeted could help people with paralysis regain control of their bodies.\par
\par
Governance and regulation in the IoT Space\par
\par
During 2023, the EU is expected to introduce legislation requiring manufacturers and operators of smart devices to follow stricter rules about how data can be collected, where it can be stored, and what they need to do to protect against breaches. This is just one piece in a raft of new legislation that we can expect to be implemented around the world. This means that 2023 may very well be the year that governments start to get to grips with the legal and social ramifications of an ever-expanding IoT. EU legislation is also expected to address issues around edge computing, which utilizes devices designed to process data at the point where it is collected rather than sending it back to centralized cloud servers to be analyzed. Meanwhile, in Asia, 2023 marks the culmination of a three-year plan by the Chinese government to put policies in place to allow the widespread adoption of IoT technology across the country. In China, as elsewhere in the world, the IoT is seen as having the potential to drive massive business growth, but there is an understanding that it needs to be grown in a managed way to avoid potential clashes with privacy issues and personal rights.\par
